# Differential-proteomic-analysis
Stepwise differentia anaysis of (Awoniyi et al., bioRxiv) data.
In this article we used proximity labeling technique (APEX2) to identify proteins 
localized to the lipid raft domain of b cells upon activation of BCR by anti-IgM.
## Steps:
- data preprocessing and cleaning
- missing value imputation
- differential analysis
- pathway analysis

## Packages used.
- dplyr
- MSnbase
